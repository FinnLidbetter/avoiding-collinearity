# avoiding-collinearity
Code and tests for determining an upper bound on the number of collinear points on an infinite walk on a finite set of vectors in Z^3.

This project is split into two parts. One is a Maven Java project with the bulk of the functionality. The other is a Cargo Rust project
with a single, smaller program.

To build the Java project, install Maven from https://maven.apache.org/ and run `mvn package` from within the `maven` directory.

To build the Rust project, install Cargo from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and run `cargo build` from within the `cargo` directory.

## Java project commands

Once the jar file has been built by `mvn package` a jar file will have been created at `maven/target/avoidingcollinearity-1.0.0.jar`.

Running `java -jar avoidingcollinearity-1.0.0.jar` will startup a command line interface with a number of commands available. These
commands are described below here with some examples.

Print the first `220` symbols of the sequence of the infinite word generated by the morphism:

```PrintSymbolSequence 220 --one-indexed```

Get the index of the last new subword of a given length using:

```IndexOfLastNewSubword 9```

Draw a sequence of trapezoids using:

  ```DrawTrapezoids wholeAndRt3 343 /home/finn/trapezoids.png```

Assert a bound on the ratio of largest and smallest distances between trapezoids separated by a minimum and maximum number of indices using:

  ```AssertBoundedDistanceRatio 7 48 wholeAndRt3 9 0```
  
Find the largest count of trapezoids separated by at most a given number of indices that are intersected by a single straight line using:

  ```CountCollinearTrapezoids 7 wholeAndRt3```

More usage information for each the com.commands can be found by using the `--help` option, for example: 

```PrintSymbolSequence --help```


## Rust project

In the `cargo/count-collinear` subdirectory, the Rust program has been run for the first 211,800 points considering all points up to index 10 million. This computation has found that there is no set of 7 collinear points in the first 10 million points of the Gerver-Ramsey construction where at least one point is in the first 211,800 points. This computation has taken approximately 3 weeks so far. The computation has been paused and this note is to serve as a reminder for where it should be continued from.
