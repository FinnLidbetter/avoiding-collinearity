# avoiding-collinearity
Code and tests for determining an upper bound on the number of collinear points on an infinite walk on a finite set of vectors in Z^3.

Navigate to the `src` folder and compile everything with `javac *.java`

Print the first `220` symbols of the sequence of the infinite word generated by the morphism:

```java com.commands.PrintSymbolSequence 220 --one-indexed```

Get the index of the last new subword of a given length using:

```java com.commands.IndexOfLastNewSubword 9```

Draw a sequence of trapezoids using:

  ```java com.commands.DrawTrapezoids wholeAndRt3 343 /home/finn/trapezoids.png```

Assert a bound on the ratio of largest and smallest distances between trapezoids separated by a minimum and maximum number of indices using:

  ```java com.commands.AssertBoundedDistanceRatio 7 48 wholeAndRt3 9 0```
  
Find the largest count of trapezoids separated by at most a given number of indices that are intersected by a single straight line using:

  ```java com.commands.CountCollinearTrapezoids 7 wholeAndRt3```

More usage information for each the com.commands can be found by using the `--help` option, for example: 

```java com.commands.PrintSymbolSequence --help```

In the count-collinear subdirectory, the Rust program has been run for the first 211,800 points considering all points up to index 10 million. This computation has found that there is no set of 7 collinear points in the first 10 million points of the Gerver-Ramsey construction where at least one point is in the first 211,800 points. This computation has taken approximately 3 weeks so far. The computation has been paused and this note is to serve as a reminder for where it should be continued from.
